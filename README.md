# Typescraper

A utility program to scrape my typing results from typeracer.com and upload it to a Google sheet.

# Future features:

- Using AWS Lambda or something similar, have a script that runs once a day, automatically feeding the data into a Google sheet;
- Store the index of the last scraped result page, so that we don't scrape all of the pages every time.
